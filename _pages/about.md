关于我  About me
======
我出生在广西北海，后来辗转成都、西安、珠海等地。2023年我从西安交通大学毕业，获得工程学士学位。2024年开始在西安交通大学鹿又水团队担任科研助理至今。预计将于2025年8月前往澳门大学攻读MSCIRAS。  
I was born in Beihai, Guangxi, and later moved through various cities including Chengdu, Xi'an, and Zhuhai. After graduating from Xi'an Jiaotong University with a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) in 2023, I joined Professor Lu Youshui's research team at the same university as a Research Assistant in 2024, where I continue to work. I am expected to commence my MSc in Intelligent Robotics and Autonomous Systems (MSCIRAS) at the University of Macau in August 2025.

我是一名电子爱好者，在本科期间学习了许多有关电子技术的知识，擅长使用各种嵌入式芯片。在担任研究助理期间，我参与研发了铁路自动化维护装备，主要负责嵌入式软件开发、机械结构设计等工作。  
I am an electronics enthusiast, and I learned a lot about electronics during my undergraduate studies, specializing in the use of various embedded chips. During my time as a research assistant, I participated in the research and development of automated railroad maintenance equipment, mainly responsible for embedded software development and mechanical structure design.

工作之余我喜欢健身、旅行、摄影，偶尔会玩电子游戏。  
Beyond working, I enjoy fitness training, traveling, photography, and occasionally playing video games.
